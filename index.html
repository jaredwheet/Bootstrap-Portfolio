                            I have worked for an insurance company for the past 9 years in Auto and Homeowners claims. 
                            The past 2.5 years, I have served as a Team Manager for Claims Associates.  I have a passion for building things,
                            and helping others. I am currently enrolled in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp to pursue a career as a Full-Stack developer.
                            I graduated from Maryville University with a B.S. in Sports Business Management. In addition to the Coding Bootcamp, I am pursuing a 
                            masters degree in Software Development from Maryville University as well to be completed following the completion of Coding Bootcamp.

                            I am a resident of Phoenix, Arizona for the past 5 years. I recently (April, 2018) married my wife Tiffany.
                            We enjoy traveling and exploring new places together. I am a sports fanatic!  I can watch just
                            about any sporting event. I love the atmosphere of attending a game in-person. I root for the St. Louis Cardinals, Duke Blue Devils. 
                            Some of my hobbies include: golfing, hiking, slowpitch softball and working out.                       
                            Please contact me if you want to talk about development, sports or anything in between!
